# Alpha v 1.0.0
Alpha is a LAYOUT Framework for CSS while maintaining vertical rhythm and progressive typography styles.

Alpha is based on **FLEXBOX**. This makes it not much backward compatible. So, i suggest you to add a polyfill. 

It is based on **12-COL** Grid. The Number of columns in a row show always sum to 12. If the sum of columns is greater than 12 ( >12) then the grid will collapse or overflows.

**Note** : Vertical rhythm is based on default font-family provided. 

## INFO
* Base font-size: 16px or 1em.
* Line-height: 24px or 1.5em; (i.e. font-size * 1.5).
* You can change the default vertical rhythm anytime later by editing the css file. 
* Body text is based on Wider sans-serif whereas headings are based on narrower serif.
