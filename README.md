# Alpha
Alpha is a LAYOUT Framework for CSS while maintaining vertical rhythm and progressive typography styles.

Note : Vertical rhythm is based on default font provided by the operating system. 

INFO
----
Base font-size: 16px or 1em.
Line-height: 24px or 1.5em; (i.e. font-size * 1.5).
All vertical margin and padding have 24px or 1.5em as value. 
You can change the default vertical rhythm anytime later by editing the css file.
